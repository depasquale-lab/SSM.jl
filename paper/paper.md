# Summary

We introduce ``StateSpaceDynamics.jl``.

# Statement of need

`SSM` [@PySSM2022] is awesome but its in python. `HiddenMarkovModels.jl` [@HMMjl2024; @Dalle2024] is awesome but XXX. `StateSpaceModels.jl` [@SSMjl2024] is awesome but XXX. `StateSpaceLearning.jl` [@SSLjl2024] is awesome but XXX.

# Package design

It is well designed. We did awesome stuff.

# Example
