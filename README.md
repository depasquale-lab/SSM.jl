This package implements a number of state-space models in julia. It take inspiration from the [SSM package](https://github.com/lindermanlab/ssm) written in python from the Linderman Lab. Currently, the following models are implemented:

- [x] Mixture Models
- [x] Hidden Markov Models
- [ ] Linear Dynamical Systems
- [ ] HMM-LDS
- [ ] Switching Linear Dynamical Systems
- [ ] recurrent Switching Linear Dynamical Systems
- [ ] Generalized Linear Models (Not state space models but needed for HMM-GLMs)
- [ ] HMM-GLM's

We are hoping to add more models in the future. If you have any suggestions, please open an issue.
